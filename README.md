## How to Use

### Step 1: Set Your Loan Details (Sidebar)

In the sidebar on the left, enter the initial details of your loan:
*   **Credit Principle Amount:** The total amount of your loan.
*   **Fixed Rate (%):** The fixed portion of your interest rate.
*   **Adjustable Rate (%):** The variable portion of your interest rate (e.g., WIBOR/POLSTR).
*   **Number of Payments (months):** The total term of your loan in months.
*   **Start Date:** The date your loan payments begin.
*   **Adjust Payment Holidays:** Enable this to add payment-free months.
*   **Show % of principle in installment:** Toggle the second chart to show the percentage of principal in each installment.

### Step 2: Simulate Scenarios (Main Window)

In the main panel, you can add different scenarios to see how they affect your loan.

*   **Lump Sum Payment:** To make an extra payment.
    *   **Format:** `YYYY-MM,amount`
    *   **Example:** To pay an additional 10,000 in March 2026, enter `2026-03,10000`.

*   **Change Adjustable Rate:** To model a change in your variable interest rate.
    *   **Format:** `YYYY-MM,change`
    *   **Example:** For a 0.25% rate increase in April 2026, enter `2026-04,0.0025`. For a decrease, use a negative sign, like `2026-04,-0.0025`.

*   **Short Loan Term:** To see the effect of shortening your loan's term after a lump-sum payment.
    *   **Format:** `YYYY-MM,months`
    *   **Example:** To shorten the loan term by 5 years (60 months) starting in March 2026, enter `2026-03,60`.

*   **Adjust Payment Holidays:** If enabled in the sidebar, you can add payment holidays.
    *   **Format:** `YYYY-MM,0`
    *   **Example:** To skip the payment in August 2025, enter `2025-08,0`.

### Step 3: Analyze the Results

*   **Metrics:** Key figures like total interest, payoff date, and the sum of your additional payments are displayed at the top.
*   **Charts:**
    1.  The first chart visualizes your remaining loan principal and the total interest paid over time, comparing the original schedule with your simulated scenario.
    2.  The second chart shows your monthly installment amount or the percentage of principal within each installment.
*   **Data Tables:** Two expandable tables at the bottom provide a detailed month-by-month breakdown of your payments for both the simulated and original loan schedules.
